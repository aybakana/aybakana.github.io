# Large Language Models (LLMs) Cheatsheet

---

## **1. What are LLMs?**
- **Definition**: LLMs are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.
- **Examples**: GPT (OpenAI), LLaMA (Meta), PaLM (Google), Claude (Anthropic), DeepSeek.
- **Applications**: Chatbots, content generation, translation, summarization, code generation, and more.

---

## **2. Key Components of LLMs**
- **Transformer Architecture**: The backbone of LLMs, using self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences.
- **Tokens**: Text is broken into smaller units (words or subwords) for processing.
- **Parameters**: Weights in the model that determine its behavior. Larger models (e.g., GPT-4 with 175B parameters) are more powerful but require more resources.
- **Context Window**: The maximum number of tokens the model can process in one go (e.g., 4096, 8192, or more).

---

## **3. Key Concepts**
- **Pretraining**: Training the model on a large corpus of text to learn language patterns.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting the model to specific tasks or domains using smaller, task-specific datasets.
- **Inference**: Using the trained model to generate text or answer questions.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting inputs (prompts) to guide the model's output.
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in output (lower = more deterministic, higher = more creative).
- **Top-k/Top-p Sampling**: Techniques to control the diversity of generated text by limiting the selection of next tokens.

---

## **4. Common Parameters in LLM Libraries**
- **`model_path`**: Path to the pre-trained model file.
- **`n_ctx`**: Context window size (max tokens the model can handle).
- **`n_batch`**: Batch size for processing tokens (improves efficiency).
- **`temperature`**: Controls randomness in output (0.1–1.0).
- **`max_tokens`**: Limits the length of the generated output.
- **`f16_kv`**: Uses float16 for key/value cache to save memory.
- **`verbose`**: Enables detailed logging for debugging.

---

## **5. Challenges with LLMs**
- **Memory Usage**: Large models require significant RAM/VRAM.
- **Compute Requirements**: High-performance GPUs/TPUs are needed for training and inference.
- **Bias**: Models can inherit biases from training data.
- **Hallucinations**: Models may generate incorrect or nonsensical information.
- **Context Limitation**: Limited by the context window size (e.g., cannot process infinitely long text).

---

## **6. Optimizing LLM Usage**
- **Use Smaller Models**: For tasks that don’t require massive models, use smaller, efficient ones (e.g., LLaMA-7B).
- **Quantization**: Reduce model size by using lower precision (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit quantization).
- **Batching**: Process multiple inputs simultaneously to improve efficiency.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Craft clear and specific prompts to get better results.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapt the model to your specific use case for better performance.

---

## **7. Popular LLM Frameworks and Tools**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Library for working with LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT).
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with LLMs.
- **Llama.cpp**: Efficient inference for LLaMA models on CPUs.
- **OpenAI API**: Access to GPT models via API.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Libraries for training and fine-tuning LLMs.

---

## **8. Prompt Engineering Tips**
- **Be Specific**: Clearly define the task in the prompt.
- **Use Examples**: Provide examples of desired output (few-shot learning).
- **Control Output**: Use parameters like `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p` to adjust creativity.
- **Iterate**: Experiment with different prompts to improve results.

---

## **9. Example Use Cases**
- **Chatbots**: Interactive conversational agents.
- **Content Creation**: Writing articles, blogs, or social media posts.
- **Code Generation**: Writing or debugging code (e.g., GitHub Copilot).
- **Summarization**: Condensing long documents into shorter summaries.
- **Translation**: Translating text between languages.

---

## **10. Ethical Considerations**
- **Bias**: Be aware of potential biases in model outputs.
- **Privacy**: Avoid inputting sensitive or personal data.
- **Misinformation**: Verify outputs to prevent spreading false information.
- **Transparency**: Clearly indicate when text is AI-generated.

---

## **11. Glossary**
- **Token**: A unit of text (word or subword) processed by the model.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task.
- **Inference**: Generating output from a trained model.
- **Context Window**: The maximum number of tokens the model can process at once.
